# Replacement Verification Report

## Summary

After verifying the replacements throughout the codebase, I found several instances where replacements were not made or should not have been made:

## 1. Remaining "tars" instances (Should NOT be replaced)

### UI-related Classes and Types
These appear to be proper names for UI components and should remain as is:
- `UITarsModel` class and interface names
- `UITarsModelVersion` type
- `UITarsModelConfig` interface
- Import statements using these class names

**Location**: `/packages/ui-tars/sdk/src/` (types.ts, Model.ts, index.ts, core.ts)

### Agent TARS Server
The `multimodal/agent-tars-server` directory contains a separate project/module that should not be renamed:
- Package name: `@agent-tars/server`
- Dependencies: `@agent-tars/core`, `@agent-tars/interface`
- Directory name: `agent-tars-server`
- Various references to "Agent TARS" as a product name

**Location**: `/multimodal/agent-tars-server/`

## 2. Remaining "agent" instances (Should NOT be replaced)

### Proper Uses of "agent"
The following uses of "agent" are correct and should not be replaced:

1. **agent-infra directory**: This is a directory name that should remain as is
2. **GUIAgent class**: This is a proper class name
3. **AgentOptions, AgentContext interfaces**: These are proper type/interface names
4. **Variable names and parameters**: Such as `agent` parameters in functions
5. **Comments referencing external projects**: References to nanobrowser agent paths

### Examples of correct usage:
- `packages/agent-infra/` - directory name
- `GUIAgent`, `GUIAgentConfig`, `GUIAgentData` - class and type names
- Function parameters like `agent?: IAgent`
- Comments mentioning agent functionality

## 3. Files Excluded from Search

The following were properly excluded:
- `.git` directory
- `node_modules` directories
- Binary files (images, fonts, etc.)
- `REPLACEMENT_SUMMARY.md` file
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` file (contains 41 instances of various forms)

## 4. Potential Issues Found

No broken imports or references were found. The replacements that were made appear to be working correctly:
- `@ui-tars/` → `@ui-ae/` in package names
- `UI-TARS` → `UI-AE` in text and documentation
- Repository URLs updated correctly

## Recommendations

1. **No further replacements needed** for the instances listed above as they are proper names, class names, or separate projects.

2. **The multimodal/agent-tars-server** directory appears to be a separate project/service and should probably remain with its current naming unless there's a specific requirement to rename it.

3. **All functional replacements appear to be complete** - package names, imports, and references have been updated correctly where appropriate.

## Verification Commands Used

```bash
# Search for remaining 'tars' instances
grep -r -i "\btars\b" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx" --include="*.json" --include="*.md" --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git

# Search for remaining 'agent' instances
grep -r "\bagent\b" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx" --include="*.json" --include="*.md" --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git

# Check specific file types
find . -type f \( -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" \) -exec grep -l "pattern" {} \;
```
